Here's an example **`README.md`** file for your **Simple Cryptocurrency System** project. This file explains the purpose of the project, how to build it, and how to run it. You can modify it further based on any additional details you'd like to include.

# Simple Cryptocurrency System

This project is a basic simulation of a cryptocurrency system using C++ to demonstrate key concepts such as **blockchain**, **transactions**, and **wallets**. The system is designed to simulate simple transactions between users, manage balances, and build a basic blockchain. 

---

## Features

- **Transaction Handling**: Users can send and receive cryptocurrency between wallets.
- **Blockchain**: Simple blockchain that records transactions in blocks.
- **Wallet**: Each user has a wallet that stores their balance and unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).
- **Transaction Validation**: Ensures that a user can only send cryptocurrency if they have sufficient balance.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (GCC or Clang)
- CMake 3.10 or higher

---

## How to Build

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project files):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptocurrency_system.git
   cd cryptocurrency_system
   ```

2. **Create a `build` directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Run CMake** to generate the build files:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Build the project** using `make`:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. After building, you will have an executable called `cryptocurrency_system` in the `build` directory.

---

## How to Run

1. **Ensure the `blockchain_data.txt` file is in place**:
   The `blockchain_data.txt` file is located in the `data/` directory. This file contains initial balances and a few blocks of transactions.

2. **Run the program**:

   From the `build` directory, run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./cryptocurrency_system
   ```

   This will read the `blockchain_data.txt` file, load the balances, process the transactions, and print the blockchain with the transaction details.

---

## Example of `blockchain_data.txt`

The `blockchain_data.txt` file contains the following sections:

1. **Balances**: Lists initial balances for each wallet address.
2. **Blocks**: Each block contains a set of transactions.

Example:

```txt
# Balances of each wallet address
Balances:
alice 50
bob 30
carol 10

# Blocks of transactions
Block 1:
alice -> bob: 20 coins
bob -> carol: 5 coins

Block 2:
alice -> carol: 10 coins
bob -> alice: 5 coins
```

## Project Details

### Classes

- **Transaction**: Represents a transaction between two wallet addresses.
- **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)**: Represents unspent outputs from transactions, allowing wallets to track funds.
- **Wallet**: Manages a wallet's balance and facilitates sending and receiving cryptocurrency.
- **Blockchain**: Stores the blockchain, which consists of blocks of transactions and a mapping of wallet balances.

### Transaction Validation

The system ensures that transactions are only valid if the sender has enough balance to cover the transaction amount.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Mining**: Implement a mining process to add new blocks with proof-of-work.
- **Transaction Fees**: Introduce a transaction fee system for each transaction.
- **Persist Blockchain**: Save and load the blockchain data to/from a file for persistence across program runs.
- **Security Features**: Implement cryptographic techniques such as digital signatures for transaction verification.
